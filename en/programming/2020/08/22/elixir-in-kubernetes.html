<meta name="description" content="Why? Because I can. Because this was the only way to setup service communication. And as I’m an Elixir writer, I’ll give code examples in Elixir (just joking, there’ll be no code examples). Source materials I used these articles: Erlang (and Elixir) distribution without epmd (more to understand what’s going on) Clustering Elixir/Erlang applications in Kubernetes (as an example for the setup) Let’s begin So, this is the situation: there’s production app with N services (N ≤ 10) deployed to k8s (openshift actually, but that doesnt matter) as a set of deploymentconfig, some deployments have k8s services and routes pointed at them. Some services (not k8s services) use redis/memcached/PG/kafka/whatever to exchange data. But suddenly (as it usually goes) a need for direct service communication appeared. For an Elixir app there’re more than one (two actually) ways of such communication: Using “third-party” protocols (grpc and others) Using OTP I decided to go with OTP for these reasons: Too lazy not enough time to implement (even with libraries) grpc and others. Dude, that’s erlang, c’mon, we’re fashion-driven programmers, aren’t we? Erlang part of things is really simple, but infrastructure caused a bit of pain. Fairytale-case scenario For fairytale-case there should be fixed DN for all instances of each service which automatically properly deployed and services have full network interconnection (tcp, ofc). Then we’ll just start the node: ERL_OPTIONS=&quot;-name ${SNAME}@${HOSTNAME} -setcookie ${ERLANG_COOKIE}&quot; elixir --erl &quot;${ERL_OPTIONS}&quot; -S mix run --no-halt And run: Node.ping(:&quot;some_other_node@some.other.domain.name&quot;) # =&gt; :pong But I don’t work in fairytale infrastructure with ponies, rainbows and respectful infrastructure ingeneers. Ugh. DN discoverability So, first problem: DNs are dynamic with regular deploymentconfig. And using some sort of service-discovery won’t work properly because erlang node wants to know it’s full DN at start. Or something like that. If we use service’ы, we can have one DN for one deploymentconfig. But what if we have multiple instances? Where the connection will go? To sort this out we have to divide services in two groups: Waiting for connection Initiating connection Waiting for connection This one’s simple but has it’s limitations. We just don’t scale these services (urghhh…). So the only instance will be available at service DN like exclusive-service.project.svc.cluster.local. Then we start an application with known DN (I decided not to set HOSTNAME, but use separate CLUSTER_HOSTNAME variable): ERL_OPTIONS=&quot;-name ${SNAME}@${CLUSTER_HOSTNAME} -setcookie ${ERLANG_COOKIE}&quot; elixir --erl &quot;${ERL_OPTIONS}&quot; -S mix run --no-halt Initiating connection This one’s even simpler: just start this process with any FQDN (so erlang to start with FQDN-mode). I just added some breach for debugging. Pods are available (through services) at &lt;pod-name&gt;.&lt;service-dn&gt; addresses, like pod-12345-qwerty.non-exclusive-service.project.svc.cluster.local. But we only know service-dn beforehand and pod-name is put into HOSTNAME variable as start. What should we do? Build effective DN at start: ERL_OPTIONS=&quot;-name ${SNAME}@${HOSTNAME}.${CLUSTER_HOSTNAME} -setcookie ${ERLANG_COOKIE}&quot; elixir --erl &quot;${ERL_OPTIONS}&quot; -S mix run --no-halt So if one service will have to instances we’ll be able to communicate to every instance with it’s name. This method could be used with service-discovery. I just use it for debugging. Ports Problem #2: port forwarding. There’re to ports required: epmd and erlang process itself empd Again, pretty simple. epmd uses 4369 as listening port. So we need to forward it in services: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service # ... spec: ports: - name: epmd port: 4369 protocol: TCP targetPort: 4369 selector: deploymentconfig: some-service # ... Erlang process That one’s a bit tricky. Every erlang process listens at some random port for OTP connections and registers at empd. For outgoing connections erlang process connects to epmd and asks “which port this process runs at?” And, as epmd problem is easily solved, “random” port requires some more handling. Forwarding all 65535 ports is not a good idea for many reasons (including me not finding directive “forward everything, I don’t care”). To enable erlang processes communication we should forward some exact port and force erlang process to listen on that port. First one is, again, simple: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service # ... spec: ports: - name: erlang-process port: 43691 protocol: TCP targetPort: 43691 selector: deploymentconfig: some-service # ... For the second one we can use inet_dist_listen_min и inet_dist_listen_max start options, which set listening port range, to limit erlang process to exactly one port: ERL_PORT=43691 ERL_KERNEL_OPTIONS=&quot;-kernel inet_dist_listen_min ${ERL_PORT} inet_dist_listen_max ${ERL_PORT}&quot; ERL_OPTIONS=&quot;-name ${SNAME}@${CLUSTER_HOSTNAME} -setcookie ${ERLANG_COOKIE} ${ERL_KERNEL_OPTIONS}&quot; elixir --erl &quot;${ERL_OPTIONS}&quot; -S mix run --no-halt And, voila, erlang processes are running and communicating! Obviously, running multiple OS erlang processes is impossible with this approach. But don’t we use k8s just for that “one process per container”? Of course, we can just omit empd at all for single-process setup, but that requires copy-pasting some actual erlang code. Conclusion This approach is for deploymentconfigs. There’s alternatice using StatefulSets, which, in theory, looks cooler, but required complete resetup for an already running production app (no downtimes allowed, ofc)." />

    <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Because I can. Because this was the only way to setup service communication.</p>

<p>And as I’m an <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> writer, I’ll give code examples in Elixir (just joking, there’ll be no code examples).</p>

<h2 id="source-materials">Source materials</h2>
<p>I used these articles:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/erlang-and-elixir-distribution-without-epmd.html">Erlang (and Elixir) distribution without epmd</a> (more to understand what’s going on)</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.ispirata.com/clustering-elixir-erlang-applications-in-kubernetes-part-1-the-theory-ca658acbf101">Clustering Elixir/Erlang applications in Kubernetes</a> (as an example for the setup)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lets-begin">Let’s begin</h2>
<p>So, this is the situation: there’s production app with N services (N ≤ 10) deployed to k8s (<a href="https://www.openshift.com/">openshift</a> actually, but that doesnt matter) as a set of deploymentconfig, some deployments have <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">k8s services</a> and <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html">routes</a> pointed at them. Some services (not k8s services) use redis/memcached/PG/kafka/whatever to exchange data.</p>

<p>But <em>suddenly</em> (as it usually goes) a need for direct service communication appeared. For an Elixir app there’re more than one (two actually) ways of such communication:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using “third-party” protocols (grpc and others)</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform">OTP</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to go with OTP for these reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li><del>Too lazy</del> not enough time to implement (even with libraries) grpc and others.</li>
  <li>Dude, that’s erlang, c’mon, we’re <em>fashion-driven</em> programmers, aren’t we?</li>
</ol>

<p>Erlang part of things is <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">really simple</a>, but infrastructure caused a bit of pain.</p>

<h2 id="fairytale-case-scenario">Fairytale-case scenario</h2>
<p>For fairytale-case there should be <strong>fixed</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">DN</a> for all instances of each service which automatically properly deployed and services have full network interconnection (tcp, ofc).</p>

<p>Then we’ll just start the node:</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"-name </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">SNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">@</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">HOSTNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2"> -setcookie </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERLANG_COOKIE</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
elixir <span class="nt">--erl</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nt">-S</span> mix run <span class="nt">--no-halt</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And run:</p>
<div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Node</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:"some_other_node@some.other.domain.name"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; :pong</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I don’t work in fairytale infrastructure with ponies, rainbows and respectful infrastructure ingeneers. Ugh.</p>

<h2 id="dn-discoverability">DN discoverability</h2>
<p>So, first problem: DNs are <strong>dynamic</strong> with regular deploymentconfig. And using some sort of service-discovery won’t work properly because erlang node wants to know it’s full DN at start.</p>

<p>Or something like that.</p>

<p>If we use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">service’ы</a>, we can have one DN for one deploymentconfig. But what if we have multiple instances? Where the connection will go?</p>

<p>To sort this out we have to divide services in two groups:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Waiting for connection</li>
  <li>Initiating connection</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="waiting-for-connection">Waiting for connection</h3>
<p>This one’s simple but has it’s limitations.</p>

<p>We just <strong>don’t scale</strong> these services (urghhh…).</p>

<p>So the only instance will be available at <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">service</a> DN like <code class="highlighter-rouge">exclusive-service.project.svc.cluster.local</code>.</p>

<p>Then we start an application with known DN (I decided not to set <code class="highlighter-rouge">HOSTNAME</code>, but use separate <code class="highlighter-rouge">CLUSTER_HOSTNAME</code> variable):</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"-name </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">SNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">@</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">CLUSTER_HOSTNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2"> -setcookie </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERLANG_COOKIE</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
elixir <span class="nt">--erl</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nt">-S</span> mix run <span class="nt">--no-halt</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="initiating-connection">Initiating connection</h3>
<p>This one’s even simpler: just start this process with any FQDN (so erlang to start with FQDN-mode). I just added some breach for debugging.</p>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/">Pods</a> are available (through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">services</a>) at <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;pod-name&gt;.&lt;service-dn&gt;</code> addresses, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">pod-12345-qwerty.non-exclusive-service.project.svc.cluster.local</code>. But we only know <code class="highlighter-rouge">service-dn</code> beforehand and <code class="highlighter-rouge">pod-name</code> is put into <code class="highlighter-rouge">HOSTNAME</code> variable as start.</p>

<p>What should we do? Build effective DN at start:</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"-name </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">SNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">@</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">HOSTNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">CLUSTER_HOSTNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2"> -setcookie </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERLANG_COOKIE</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
elixir <span class="nt">--erl</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nt">-S</span> mix run <span class="nt">--no-halt</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So if one service will have to instances we’ll be able to communicate to every instance with it’s name. This method could be used with service-discovery. I just use it for debugging.</p>

<h2 id="ports">Ports</h2>
<p>Problem #2: port forwarding. There’re to ports required: <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/epmd.html">epmd</a> and erlang process itself</p>

<h3 id="empd">empd</h3>
<p>Again, pretty simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/epmd.html">epmd</a> uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">4369</code> as listening port. So we need to forward it in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">services</a>:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">apiVersion</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">v1</span>
<span class="na">kind</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Service</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="na">spec</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">ports</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">epmd</span>
      <span class="na">port</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">4369</span>
      <span class="na">protocol</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">TCP</span>
      <span class="na">targetPort</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">4369</span>
  <span class="na">selector</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">deploymentconfig</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">some-service</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="erlang-process">Erlang process</h3>
<p>That one’s a bit tricky. Every erlang process listens at some random port for OTP connections and registers at empd. For outgoing connections erlang process connects to epmd and asks “which port <em>this</em> process runs at?”</p>

<p>And, as epmd problem is easily solved, “random” port requires some more handling.</p>

<p>Forwarding all 65535 ports is not a good idea for many reasons (including me not finding directive “forward everything, I don’t care”).</p>

<p>To enable erlang processes communication we should forward some <strong>exact</strong> port and force erlang process to listen on that port.</p>

<p>First one is, again, simple:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">apiVersion</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">v1</span>
<span class="na">kind</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Service</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="na">spec</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">ports</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">erlang-process</span>
      <span class="na">port</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">43691</span>
      <span class="na">protocol</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">TCP</span>
      <span class="na">targetPort</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">43691</span>
  <span class="na">selector</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">deploymentconfig</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">some-service</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the second one we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">inet_dist_listen_min</code> и <code class="highlighter-rouge">inet_dist_listen_max</code> start options, which set listening port range, to limit erlang process to exactly one port:</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">ERL_PORT</span><span class="o">=</span>43691
<span class="nv">ERL_KERNEL_OPTIONS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"-kernel inet_dist_listen_min </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERL_PORT</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2"> inet_dist_listen_max </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERL_PORT</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"-name </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">SNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">@</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">CLUSTER_HOSTNAME</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2"> -setcookie </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERLANG_COOKIE</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERL_KERNEL_OPTIONS</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
elixir <span class="nt">--erl</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ERL_OPTIONS</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nt">-S</span> mix run <span class="nt">--no-halt</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, voila, erlang processes are running and communicating!</p>

<p>Obviously, running multiple OS erlang processes is impossible with this approach. But don’t we use k8s just for that “one process per container”?</p>

<p>Of course, we can just <a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/erlang-and-elixir-distribution-without-epmd.html">omit empd at all</a> for single-process setup, but that requires copy-pasting some actual erlang code.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach is for deploymentconfigs. There’s alternatice <a href="https://blog.ispirata.com/clustering-elixir-erlang-applications-in-kubernetes-part-1-the-theory-ca658acbf101">using StatefulSets</a>, which, in theory, looks cooler, but required complete resetup for an already running production app (no downtimes allowed, ofc).</p>
