Sample data model and API To demonstrate canonical OpenAPI approach problem I need to describe some model and few API methods on it. I’ll take online-store product as an example. Data model Attributes (there might be more, but that’s enough): Name (string) — name Description (string) — description Vendor code (number) — vendor_code Picture (file) — picture Let’s describe canonical OpenAPI scheme: components: schemas: Product: type: object description: Product properties: name: type: string description: Name description: type: string description: Description vendor_code: type: number description: Vendor code picture: type: string format: binary description: Picture HTTP API We need to describe two API-methods: “create” and “get”. Create method will look like this: paths: /api/products: post: summary: Create product requestBody: required: true content: multipart/form-data: schema: &quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;#/components/schemas/Product&quot; responses: &#39;200&#39;: # ... And get method will look like this: paths: /api/products/{id}: get: summary: Get product parameters: - name: id in: query description: Product ID schema: type: string responses: &#39;200&#39;: content: application/json: schema: $ref: &quot;#/components/schemas/Product&quot; Seems legit? Well, yes, but no. Broken API Example What’s wrong? In real world scenario no one is going to build an API that consumes file as binary data (as part of multipart/form-data) and returns file as binary data (as part of application/json). Response will most probably look like: picture: type: object description: Picture properties: link: type: string description: File url filename: type: string description: File name In terms of OpenAPI it means, that producer is not equal to consumer. So we can’t use the same schema for both. Is there any thing we can do? In the world of ponies and rainbows we’ll be able to describe a model and then cut/amend it however we need. But not only it’s unsupported (such merge won’t ever be part of standard and allOf is both broken and not meant for amending but combination), it’s also dangerous, because no one can guess how base model changes will affect derived model. Don’t use common schemas And just write full descriptions at every place. But that’s going to be hell of a duplication. And, considering how redundant OpenAPI description is, the documentat is going to be huge. Impractically huge. Take common descriptions to the upper level I’m not talking about files, but abstraction level. Common descriptions are property descriptions. And that’s what we’re going to take from method descriptions somewhere else. OpenAPI does not specify what exact schemas we must should describe, so describing subschemas should be easy. Then we’ll describe final schemas inside methods, but use property refs instead of full property descriptions. «Hacked» API Model properties description: components: schemas: Product::name: type: string description: Name Product::description: type: string description: Description Product::vendor_code: type: number description: Vendor code Product::picture: type: object description: Picture properties: link: type: string description: File url filename: type: string description: File name Product::picture::upload: type: string format: binary description: Picture Use property descriptions in methods Create will now look like this: paths: /api/products: post: summary: Create product requestBody: required: true content: multipart/form-data: schema: type: object properties: name: {&quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;#/components/schemas/Product::name&quot;} description: {&quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;#/components/schemas/Product::description&quot;} vendor_code: {&quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;#/components/schemas/Product::vendor_code&quot;} picture: {&quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;#/components/schemas/Product::picture::upload&quot;} responses: &#39;200&#39;: # ...

<p>Back in the days I used <a href="http://apidocjs.com/">apiDoc</a>. Wonderful tool. But growing project caused apiDoc to fail.</p>

<p>When time has come to look for something else there were two options: <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>.</p>

<p>Spent some time (about 4 hour) failing to make API Blueprint work with deepObject parameters I went with the only option left — mysterious OpenAPI.</p>

<h2 id="sample-data-model-and-api">Sample data model and API</h2>
<p>To demonstrate canonical OpenAPI approach problem I need to describe some model and few API methods on it.

<h2 id="whats-wrong">What’s wrong?</h2>
<p>In real world scenario no one is going to build an API that consumes file as binary data (as part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">multipart/form-data</code>) and returns file as binary data (as part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/json</code>).
Response will most probably look like:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">picture</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">object</span>
  <span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Picture</span>
  <span class="na">properties</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">link</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">string</span>
      <span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">File url</span>
    <span class="na">filename</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">string</span>
      <span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">File name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In terms of OpenAPI it means, that producer is not equal to consumer. So we can’t use the same schema for both. Is there any thing we can do?</p>

<p>In the world of ponies and rainbows we’ll be able to describe a model and then cut/amend it however we need. But not only it’s unsupported (<a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/674">such merge won’t ever be part of standard</a> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">allOf</code> is both <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3674">broken</a> and not meant for amending but combination), it’s also dangerous, because no one can guess how base model changes will affect derived model.</p>

<h3 id="dont-use-common-schemas">Don’t use common schemas</h3>
<p>And just write full descriptions at every place.</p>

<p>But that’s going to be hell of a duplication. And, considering how redundant OpenAPI description is, the documentat is going to be huge. Impractically huge.</p>

<h3 id="take-common-descriptions-to-the-upper-level">Take common descriptions to the upper level</h3>
<p>I’m not talking about files, but abstraction level.</p>

<p>Common descriptions are <em>property</em> descriptions. And that’s what we’re going to take from method descriptions somewhere else.</p>

<p>OpenAPI does not specify what exact schemas we <del>must</del> should describe, so describing subschemas should be easy.</p>

<p>Then we’ll describe final schemas inside methods, but use property refs instead of full property descriptions.</p>

<h3 id="some-sort-of-conclusion">Some sort of conclusion</h3>
<p>That way of describing is closer to real life actually.</p>

<p>One rarely write the same code to consume and to render data. But properties (even within code) are often the same (types and descriptions), except files (and alike).</p>

<h2 id="some-additional-shitty-code">Some additional shitty code</h2>
<p>The other OpenAPI problem is this: descriptions can only be in one file. I can understand why they (OpenAPI authors) did it but it’s not that convenient.</p>

<p>It’s easy to fix: parse all files, merge and render into a single file.</p>

<p>It happend so that <a href="https://github.com/ivalentinee/openapi-merger">I already built such tool</a>. Not sure if it works :)</p>
