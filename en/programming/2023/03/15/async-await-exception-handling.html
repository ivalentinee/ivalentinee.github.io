Example: async function fail() { throw new Error(&#39;Ultimate failure&#39;); } console.log(fail()); // Promise { &lt;rejected&gt; Error: Ultimate failure } Await and promise unwrapping Await does promise unwrapping for other async-function returned values called with await: async function returnNumber() { return 1; } console.log(await returnNumber()); // 1 And if returned promise is rejected that exception is rethrown (and then re-wrapped with Promise.reject if not catched with try-catch): async function fail() { throw new Error(&#39;Ultimate failure&#39;); } console.log(await fail()); // console.log won&#39;t print anything, but &#39;Uncaught Error: Ultimate failure&#39; will be displayed What’s the problem and how to solve it?

How to avoid that? Try to return all async function results through await in try-catch blocks even if it looks unnecessary: try { const result = await fail(); return result; } catch (error) { logger.log(error); return undefined; } And call async function with await even if these functions do not return any actual value (Promise&lt;void&gt;): await fail(); Yes, excessive promise wrapping/unwrapping will cause more event loop cycles to pass results, but that tiny overhead will stabilize the system at code level significantly.

<p>All of a sudden I started writing NodeJS code about a year ago. Didn’t want to, but there was no choice – code should cross-compile for both browser and server.</p>

<p>It turned out that async/await in JS is a complicated topic for many. And if most problematic cases are highlighted by TypeScript, this situation is correct by both JS and TS, but the code fails when it should not.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Can you guess what’s wrong here?</p>

<p>Even eslint marks example 1 code as incorrect. “Thank you eslint for that”.</p>

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>
<p>Now here’s some code which tells what’s wrong with example 2:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kr">await</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">async</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">})();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">'The error was not caught'</code> won’t be printed because the error is not caught in the second function.</p>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<p>To explain this I have to explain async/await a bit deeper (but not too much).</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">Async/await</a> is just a syntactic sugar for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">promises</a> which on the other hand are just a syntactic sugar for callbacks. These two allows for asynchronous code to be written in “pseudo-synchronous” manner.</p>

<h4 id="async-functions">Async functions</h4>
<p>Marking function as <code class="highlighter-rouge">async</code> allows to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> in function definition.</p>

<p>Aside from that, if async function returns non-promise, returned value is wrapped into a promise (with somethin like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise.resolve(value)</code>).<br />
Example:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">returnNumber</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">returnNumber</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="c1">// Promise { 1 }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, finally, if async function throws an error that error is automatically wrapped into a promise too (with something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise.reject(exception)</code>).<br />
Example:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Ultimate failure'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="c1">// Promise { &lt;rejected&gt; Error: Ultimate failure }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="await-and-promise-unwrapping">Await and promise unwrapping</h4>
<p>Await does promise unwrapping for other async-function returned values called with <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code>:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">returnNumber</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">await</span> <span class="nx">returnNumber</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="c1">// 1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And if returned promise is rejected that exception is rethrown (and then re-wrapped with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise.reject</code> if not catched with try-catch):</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Ultimate failure'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">await</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="c1">// console.log won't print anything, but 'Uncaught Error: Ultimate failure' will be displayed</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="whats-the-problem-and-how-to-solve-it">What’s the problem and how to solve it?</h3>
<p>So if the last (up the call stack) try-catch won’t have <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> when calling probably-exception-throwing-async-function promise will be returned as-is (rejected) and try-catch won’t get into <code class="highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block. Successfully passing try-catch exception will then be fired by the system.</p>

<p>And if unhandled exception in browser results in just a red line in dev-tools, server will have the entire NodeJS process down (well, if no wanky code like <code class="highlighter-rouge">process.on('uncaughtException', (error: Error) =&gt; { /* ... */ });</code> will be used) and if lucky will just be restarted (losing all the data).</p>

<p>How to avoid that? Try to return all async function results through <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> in try-catch blocks even if it looks unnecessary:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kr">await</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">logger</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And call async function with <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> even if these functions do not return any actual value (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>):</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">await</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yes, excessive promise wrapping/unwrapping will cause more event loop cycles to pass results, but that tiny overhead will stabilize the system at code level significantly.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It turned out, problematic code is usually written by developers that have almost no experience with NodeJS – those who write code for browser or write so little code that such async-related problems never occur.</p>

<p>Now I use this question (async/await with exceptions) on interviews to find out if candidate actually used NodeJS or just played with it.</p>
