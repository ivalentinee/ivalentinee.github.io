And if unhandled exception in browser results in just a red line in dev-tools, server will have the entire NodeJS process down (well, if no wanky code like process.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;, (error: Error) =&gt; { /* ... */ }); will be used) and if lucky will just be restarted (losing all the data). How to avoid that? Try to return all async function results through await in try-catch blocks even if it looks unnecessary: try { const result = await fail(); return result; } catch (error) { logger.log(error); return undefined; } And call async function with await even if these functions do not return any actual value (Promise&lt;void&gt;): await fail(); Yes, excessive promise wrapping/unwrapping will cause more event loop cycles to pass results, but that tiny overhead will stabilize the system at code level significantly. Conclusion It turned out, problematic code is usually written by developers that have almost no experience with NodeJS – those who write code for browser or write so little code that such async-related problems never occur.

<p>All of a sudden I started writing NodeJS code about a year ago. Didn’t want to, but there was no choice – code should cross-compile for both browser and server.</p>

<p>It turned out that async/await in JS is a complicated topic for many. And if most problematic cases are highlighted by TypeScript, this situation is correct by both JS and TS, but the code fails when it should not.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Problem happens when trying to catch errors in async functions.</p>

<p>Can you guess what’s wrong here?</p>

<p>Even eslint marks example 1 code as incorrect. “Thank you eslint for that”.</p>

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>
<p>Now here’s some code which tells what’s wrong with example 2:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="kr">await</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">async</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">})();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">'The error was not caught'</code> won’t be printed because the error is not caught in the second function.</p>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<p>To explain this I have to explain async/await a bit deeper (but not too much).</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">Async/await</a> is just a syntactic sugar for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">promises</a> which on the other hand are just a syntactic sugar for callbacks. These two allows for asynchronous code to be written in “pseudo-synchronous” manner.</p>

<h4 id="async-functions">Async functions</h4>
<p>Marking function as <code class="highlighter-rouge">async</code> allows to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> in function definition.</p>

<p>Aside from that, if async function returns non-promise, returned value is wrapped into a promise (with somethin like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise.resolve(value)</code>).<br />
Example:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">returnNumber</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">returnNumber</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="c1">// Promise { 1 }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, finally, if async function throws an error that error is automatically wrapped into a promise too (with something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise.reject(exception)</code>).<br />
Example:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Ultimate failure'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="c1">// Promise { &lt;rejected&gt; Error: Ultimate failure }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="await-and-promise-unwrapping">Await and promise unwrapping</h4>
<p>Await does promise unwrapping for other async-function returned values called with <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code>:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">returnNumber</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>And if returned promise is rejected that exception is rethrown (and then re-wrapped with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise.reject</code> if not catched with try-catch):</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Ultimate failure'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">await</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="c1">// console.log won't print anything, but 'Uncaught Error: Ultimate failure' will be displayed</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="whats-the-problem-and-how-to-solve-it">What’s the problem and how to solve it?</h3>
<p>So if the last (up the call stack) try-catch won’t have <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> when calling probably-exception-throwing-async-function promise will be returned as-is (rejected) and try-catch won’t get into <code class="highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block. Successfully passing try-catch exception will then be fired by the system.</p>

<p>And if unhandled exception in browser results in just a red line in dev-tools, server will have the entire NodeJS process down (well, if no wanky code like <code class="highlighter-rouge">process.on('uncaughtException', (error: Error) =&gt; { /* ... */ });</code> will be used) and if lucky will just be restarted (losing all the data).</p>

<p>How to avoid that? Try to return all async function results through <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> in try-catch blocks even if it looks unnecessary:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kr">await</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">logger</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And call async function with <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code> even if these functions do not return any actual value (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>):</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">await</span> <span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yes, excessive promise wrapping/unwrapping will cause more event loop cycles to pass results, but that tiny overhead will stabilize the system at code level significantly.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It turned out, problematic code is usually written by developers that have almost no experience with NodeJS – those who write code for browser or write so little code that such async-related problems never occur.</p>

<p>Now I use this question (async/await with exceptions) on interviews to find out if candidate actually used NodeJS or just played with it.</p>
